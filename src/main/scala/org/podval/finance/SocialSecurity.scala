// Adjustments for Claiming Age
//
// The earliest eligibility age is the age at which a retired worker can first claim benefits (age 62).
// The full retirement age (FRA) is the age at which the worker can receive the full PIA increased by any COLAs.
// For workers born in 1960 or later, the FRA is age 67.
//
// The permanent reduction in monthly benefits that applies to people who claim before the FRA
// is an actuarial reduction.
// It equals five-ninths of 1% for each month (6â…”% per year) for the first three years of early claim
// and five-twelfths of 1% for each month (5% per year) beyond 36 months.
//
// The permanent increase in monthly benefits that applies to those who claim after the FRA
// is called the delayed retirement credit (DRC).
// For people born after 1942, the DRC is 8% for each year of delayed claim after the FRA up to age 70.
